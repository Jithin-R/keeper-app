# keeper-app
Basically this is a clone of __Google Keep__. The React frontend used in this project is from [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) 
course on Udemy. I've added some features to the frontend and connected it to a database using REST API which I did using Django Rest Framework..

# Dependencies
- React js
- Django
- Django Rest Framework
- Axios

# Getting Started
1. Open the API folder and setup a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
 ```bash
 source env/bin/activate
 ```
 
3. Install the required dependencies from ***requirements.txt***
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

4. Then run the server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Then open the client folder and run the below code. This will install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

6. Start the react app
```bash
npm start
```

#### That's it a fully functional Keeper App is up and runnning
